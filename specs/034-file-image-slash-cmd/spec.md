# Feature Specification: File & Image Slash Commands

**Folder**: `specs/034-file-image-slash-cmd/`  
**Created**: 2026-05-02  
**Status**: Implemented ✅  
**PRD Domains**: `slash-commands`, `images`  
**Input**: Bug report — the `/image` slash command dispatched a dead `slashCommandInsertImage` CustomEvent with no listener, doing nothing. Required fix and UX parity with `/file` command. Also added Obsidian-style active link preview.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 — Insert Image via Slash Command (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to type `/image` in the editor and pick a file from my workspace to embed as an image, so that I can quickly insert images without leaving the editor.

**Why this priority**: The `/image` slash command existed visually but was completely non-functional — clicking it dispatched a `CustomEvent` with no handler, silently doing nothing.

**Independent Test**: Type `/image`, select an image file from the picker, verify a `![filename](path)` node appears in the editor.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I type `/image` in the editor, **When** the slash suggestion menu appears and I select "Image", **Then** an inline file-search picker opens.
2. **Given** the file picker is open, **When** I type a search query, **Then** the list filters files from the workspace cache in real time.
3. **Given** a file is selected from the picker, **When** I press Enter or click it, **Then** a TipTap image node is inserted at the cursor position with `src` = file path and `alt` = filename.
4. **Given** I type `/img` (alias), **When** the slash suggestion menu appears, **Then** Image is highlighted and the same picker behavior applies.

### User Story 2 — Insert File Link via Slash Command (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to type `/link` or `/file` and pick a workspace file to insert as a clickable markdown link, so that I can cross-reference other documents.

**Why this priority**: File Link was already functional but used its own inline `openFilePicker` function. Parity with the Image command requires both to use the same shared picker.

**Independent Test**: Type `/link`, pick a `.md` file, verify a `[filename](path)` text-with-link-mark node appears in the editor.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I type `/link` or `/file` in the editor, **When** I select "File Link" from the menu, **Then** an inline file-search picker opens using the same UI as the Image picker.
2. **Given** a file is selected, **When** I press Enter or click it, **Then** a text node with a `link` mark is inserted: display text = filename, href = file path.
3. **Given** I type `/link some-doc`, **When** the slash menu is open, **Then** the picker pre-filters on `some-doc`.

### User Story 3 — Active File Link Preview (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see the file path of a link I am currently editing inline next to the link text (Obsidian-style), so that I know where the link points without opening a separate dialog.

**Why this priority**: File links become opaque once named. Showing the href inline while the cursor is inside the link provides immediate context.

**Independent Test**: Place cursor inside a `[display text](./some-file.md)` link and verify the href appears visually next to the link text without modifying the document.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the cursor is positioned inside a file link (local path, not `http://`, `mailto:`, or `#anchor`), **When** `onSelectionUpdate` fires, **Then** the anchor DOM element gets class `link-edit-preview` and `data-link-href` = the file path.
2. **Given** the `.link-edit-preview` class is on an anchor, **When** rendered, **Then** a CSS `::after` pseudo-element displays `(href)` in a muted color after the link text.
3. **Given** the cursor moves away from the link, **When** `onSelectionUpdate` fires, **Then** the `link-edit-preview` class and `data-link-href` attribute are removed — the document markdown is unchanged.
4. **Given** the link href is an external URL (`https://...`), **When** the cursor is inside it, **Then** no preview is shown (only local file paths get preview).

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR-001 | `/image` and `/img` slash commands must open an inline workspace file picker and insert a TipTap image node on selection |
| FR-002 | `/link` and `/file` slash commands must open the same inline workspace file picker and insert a text node with a `link` mark on selection |
| FR-003 | Both pickers must share a single `openWorkspacePicker(editor, insertFrom, mode)` implementation — no duplication |
| FR-004 | The picker must query `fileCache.search(query, maxResults)` with the user's typed search term to filter results |
| FR-005 | The picker must support keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/ArrowDown to move, Enter to select, Escape to cancel) |
| FR-006 | When cursor is inside a local file link, the editor must show the file path inline via CSS `::after` without modifying stored markdown |
| FR-007 | Link preview must only activate for local file paths — not for `http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`, or `#` links |

---

## Success Criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| SC-001 | `/image` command opens picker and inserts a valid image node — previously broken, now functional |
| SC-002 | `/img` (alias) exhibits identical behavior to `/image` |
| SC-003 | `/link` and `/file` commands work via the same shared `openWorkspacePicker` (no duplicate code paths) |
| SC-004 | Active cursor in a local file link shows path preview without any markdown content change |
| SC-005 | All existing tests pass — no regressions in CommandRegistry behavior |

---

## Out of Scope

- Remote URL input for images (only workspace files)
- Image resizing or caption editing
- Editing an existing link's href via the preview (read-only preview only)
- Custom link picker styling beyond the shared picker UX

## Bug Fixes (May 2026)

### Bug #1: Non-Image Formats Appearing in `/image` Slash Command
**Issue**: When using `/image` slash command, the file picker was showing non-image files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`) along with actual image formats. Initial results correctly showed only images, but as soon as the user typed a search query, all matching files appeared regardless of extension.

**Root Cause**: In `openWorkspacePicker()`, the input event listener was calling `fileCache.search(query, 15)` without applying the image format filter. The filter was only applied to initial results, not to search results.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified input event listener in `openWorkspacePicker()` to filter results by `isImagePath(file.path)` when `mode === 'image'`
- Filter now consistently applies to both initial results and search results
- Image format validation regex: `/\.(png|jpe?g|gif|svg|webp|bmp|ico|tiff?)$/i`

**Location**: `src/webview/extensions/CommandRegistry.ts` (lines 177-185)

### Bug #2: Stale File Cache - New Workspace Images Not Appearing
**Issue**: When a user added new images to their workspace after opening the editor, the `/image` slash command would not show the newly added files. Users had to restart the editor for new files to appear in the picker.

**Root Cause**: The workspace file cache (`fileCache`) was populated once during editor initialization via `GET_WORKSPACE_FILES` message. The cache was never refreshed, so new workspace files added after init were never discovered.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `fileCache.requestRefresh()` method that dispatches a fresh `GET_WORKSPACE_FILES` message to the extension
- Called `fileCache.requestRefresh()` whenever `openWorkspacePicker()` is invoked (before rendering initial results)
- Fresh workspace file list is fetched from extension and populated via `WORKSPACE_FILES_RESULT` message
- Users now see current workspace files every time they trigger `/image` or `/file` commands

**Location**: 
- `src/webview/utils/fileCache.ts` (lines 45-52): New `requestRefresh()` method
- `src/webview/extensions/CommandRegistry.ts` (line 207): Call to `fileCache.requestRefresh()` before opening picker

### Bug #3: Race Condition - Picker Shows Stale Cache (Renamed Files Not Appearing)
**Issue**: When a file is renamed in the workspace, the slash command picker would not immediately show the new filename. Users had to type a search query or wait for initial results to update. The picker showed cached results before the fresh file list arrived from the extension.

**Root Cause**: `requestRefresh()` is asynchronous — it sends a `GET_WORKSPACE_FILES` message but returns immediately. The picker then shows initial results using the old cache before the response arrives. The response eventually updates the cache, but by then the picker is already rendered with stale data.

**Fix Applied**:
- Made `fileCache.requestRefresh()` return a `Promise<void>` that resolves when fresh files arrive
- Added internal `refreshPromise` tracking to handle concurrent refresh requests
- Updated `setFiles()` to resolve pending refresh promises
- Wrapped entire `openWorkspacePicker()` in an async IIFE that **awaits** the refresh before rendering picker
- Picker now guaranteed to show current workspace files every time it opens (including renamed files)

**Location**:
- `src/webview/utils/fileCache.ts` (lines 13-14, 46-68): Promise-based refresh with resolution tracking
- `src/webview/extensions/CommandRegistry.ts` (lines 35-208): Entire function wrapped in `async ()` that awaits refresh before UI render
