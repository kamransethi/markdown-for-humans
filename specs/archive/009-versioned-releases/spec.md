# Feature Specification: Versioned Release Management

**Folder**: `specs/009-versioned-releases/`  
**Created**: April 11, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**PRD Domains**: `dev-tooling`  
**Input**: User request: "I'd like a more mature release process where each of the releases is stored in a versioned folder in releases, along with release notes, which are then published as a release. I think only release notes are needed which I'll ask you to prep for the last release to github"

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL

All requested features have been implemented, tested, and are production-ready.

## What Was Implemented

- **Versioned Release Folders**: Semantic versioning structure (releases/v2.0.30/)
- **Automated VSIX Organization**: Build process moves packaged extensions to versioned folders
Release processes need to be repeatable and require minimal manual steps to ensure consistency across all releases and reduce opportunities for error.

**Why this priority**: Reduces errors and ensures quality consistency; P1 because it affects every release.

**Independent Test**: Running the release build command (`npm run vsix`) automatically handles all release folder organization without requiring manual file operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the release build command is executed, **When** the build completes, **Then** no manual file reorganization is needed
2. **Given** a release maintainer builds multiple releases in sequence, **When** examining each release, **Then** the folder structure and file placement is identical across versions
3. **Given** a developer creates a release for a new version, **When** the build process completes, **Then** they can immediately publish without additional prep work
4. **Given** the build process creates a VSIX file, **When** examining the project, **Then** the file is in the correct versioned folder ready for use

**ACTUAL BEHAVIOR** (Implementation):
- ✅ `npm run vsix` automates the entire release process
- ✅ Post-build hooks automatically organize artifacts
- ✅ No manual folder creation or file movement needed
- ✅ Consistent structure across all versions
- ✅ Process is developer-friendly and error-resistant

### User Story 3 - GitHub Release Publishing (Priority: P2)

Release maintainers need to easily publish releases to GitHub with all necessary information already organized and formatted for direct use.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience for marketplace publishing; P2 because automation handles most cases.

**Independent Test**: Release notes are pre-formatted and ready to copy-paste directly into a GitHub Release page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** release notes are prepared in the versioned folder, **When** creating a GitHub Release, **Then** release notes can be used directly in the release description
2. **Given** a VSIX file is in the versioned folder, **When** publishing to GitHub, **Then** the file can be easily attached to the release
3. **Given** a user wants to check for releases, **When** they visit GitHub Releases, **Then** they see well-formatted release information

**ACTUAL BEHAVIOR** (Implementation):
- ✅ Release notes formatted for GitHub
- ✅ Ready for direct copy-paste to GitHub Releases
- ✅ VSIX file easily accessible for upload
- ✅ All metadata organized and discoverable

The release maintainer wants to be able to prepare release notes for the currently deployed version (e.g., v2.0.30) that can be used as a template or baseline for future releases. This enables retrospective documentation of what was included in the most recent release.

**Why this priority**: This enables the first release to use the new versioned process. Once established, future releases can follow the same pattern. It also serves as a reference for understanding what constituted the previous release and sets a baseline for release notes structure.

**Independent Test**: Given the current version is 2.0.30, the release maintainer can prepare release notes for this version (gathering feature commits, bug fixes, dependency updates since the last tagged release) and store them in `releases/v2.0.30/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current deployed version is 2.0.30, **When** the release maintainer requests to prepare release notes for this version, **Then** they receive a structured template with sections ready to be filled in
2. **Given** release notes are prepared and stored in `releases/v2.0.30/`, **When** reviewing the folder, **Then** all prior versions and the new versioned release are discoverable together in the `releases/` directory

---

### User Story 5 - Release Process Workflow Is Minimal and Repeatable (Priority: P2)

The release maintainer wants the release process to be straightforward and repeatable, so that each subsequent release (2.0.31, 2.0.32, etc.) can be published following the same pattern without confusion or missed steps.

**Why this priority**: Once the process is established, future releases should be easy to execute with minimal overhead. A repeatable workflow reduces risk of errors and ensures consistency across releases.

**Independent Test**: A new release (2.0.31) can be created by following the same steps used for the previous release (2.0.30), resulting in a consistent folder structure, release notes location, and GitHub publishing outcome.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the first versioned release (2.0.30) has been published, **When** preparing a second release (2.0.31), **Then** the same folder structure and release notes format are used
2. **Given** a release workflow exists, **When** it is documented clearly, **Then** any release maintainer can follow it without ambiguity

### Edge Cases

- What happens if release notes contain breaking changes that require user migration? → Release notes must clearly mark breaking changes and provide migration guidance
- What happens if a release needs to be patched after publication? → A new version folder can be created (e.g., v2.0.30-patch or v2.0.31) and published to GitHub Releases, superseding the previous version
- What happens if release metadata (e.g., build artifacts, checksums) needs to be stored with the release? → The versioned folder structure allows for additional files beyond release notes (e.g., checksums, build logs, related artifacts)
- What if older releases need to be marked as deprecated or pre-release? → GitHub Releases supports pre-release and draft status flags that can be applied during publishing

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a directory structure `releases/vX.Y.Z/` for each versioned release (where X.Y.Z follows Semantic Versioning)
- **FR-002**: Release notes MUST be stored in a standardized, discoverable filename within each versioned release folder (e.g., `RELEASE_NOTES.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`)
- **FR-003**: Release notes format MUST be Markdown-based and follow a consistent structure across all releases (sections for Features Added, Bug Fixes, Breaking Changes, Dependencies Updated, etc.)
- **FR-004**: Release maintainers MUST be able to prepare release notes for the current/last deployed version with clear, minimal effort
- **FR-005**: Versioned releases and their notes MUST be easily publishable to GitHub Releases without additional manual steps or versioning conflicts
- **FR-006**: The release folder structure MUST remain unchanged and reusable for all future releases (new feature releases, patch releases, pre-releases)
- **FR-007**: Each release folder MAY contain additional metadata beyond release notes (e.g., build artifacts, checksums, version tags) without conflict

### Key Entities

- **Release**: A versioned snapshot of the application (identified by semantic version tag, e.g., v2.0.30). Each release has an associated folder and release notes.
- **Release Notes**: A Markdown document describing the changes in a specific release (new features, bug fixes, dependencies, breaking changes, migration guidance). Stored in each release folder.
- **Release Folder**: A directory structure `releases/vX.Y.Z/` containing all artifacts and documentation for a specific release version.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: When a release is versioned and stored in the `releases/` directory, it is discoverable within 5 seconds by navigating to the releases folder (clear folder naming, no confusion)
- **SC-002**: Release maintainers can prepare release notes for a new version in under 15 minutes using a standardized template (measured by workflow efficiency)
- **SC-003**: Each release can be published to GitHub Releases and appear correctly on the GitHub Releases page with full release notes visible (100% accuracy)
- **SC-004**: The release folder structure accommodates at least 50 versioned releases without naming conflicts or confusion (scalability)
- **SC-005**: Release notes for all published versions are searchable and accessible via GitHub without requiring external documentation tools (accessibility)
- **SC-006**: The release process is repeatable: two consecutive releases follow identical folder structure and release notes format with zero manual corrections needed (consistency)

## Assumptions

- **Versioning Scheme**: The project uses Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for release numbering (e.g., v2.0.30, v2.0.31), reflecting the current version numbering in package.json
- **Release Notes Format**: Release notes are written in Markdown format and stored with a standard filename (`RELEASE_NOTES.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`) for consistency and discoverability
- **GitHub as Distribution Channel**: GitHub Releases is the primary mechanism for publishing releases to users and maintaining release history
- **Release Notes Content**: Release notes include standard sections: Features Added, Bug Fixes, Breaking Changes (if any), Dependencies Updated, and Migration Guidance (if needed), following CHANGELOG.md conventions
- **Starting Point**: The first versioned release to be published is the current version (2.0.30), establishing the process baseline for future releases
- **Pre-releases and Patches**: The system supports both standard releases and pre-releases (alpha, beta, rc) or patch releases (e.g., v2.0.30-patch) through GitHub's labeling capabilities; no additional folder structure is needed
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code and workflows are not affected by introducing the new release folder structure; the new system is additive and non-breaking
- **Manual Publishing**: Release notes preparation is a manual process performed by the release maintainer; automation of release generation itself is out of scope for this feature (only documentation/organization is in scope)
