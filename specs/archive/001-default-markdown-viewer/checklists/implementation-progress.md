## Quick Start

To begin implementation:

1. **Start Phase 1 (RED)**: Follow tasks 1.1 through 1.7 to write all failing tests
2. **Verify Tests Fail**: Run `npm test -- defaultViewerPrompt` — all tests should FAIL
3. **Proceed to Phase 2**: Once all tests are written and failing, implement the function
4. **Continue Phases 3 & 4**: Polish, verify, and merge when complete
